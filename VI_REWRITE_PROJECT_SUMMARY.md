# Vi Editor Python Rewrite - Super-Planner Project

## Project Details

- **Project ID**: `9d16c244-42ba-4ce9-91bc-cb928c869e75`
- **Name**: Vi Editor Python Rewrite with TDD
- **Total Tasks**: 29
- **Execution Phases**: 14
- **Saved Location**: `/workspaces/amplifier/data/planner/projects/9d16c244-42ba-4ce9-91bc-cb928c869e75.json`

## Critical Requirements Met

✓ **Test-First Development**: Every implementation task depends on a corresponding test task that must complete first
✓ **File-Based Testing**: Test framework specifically designed for input/actions/expected output file comparison
✓ **Comprehensive Coverage**: 14 dedicated test tasks covering all features
✓ **No LLM Self-Assessment**: All tests use diff-based file comparison for verification
✓ **Modular Architecture**: Begins with architecture design phase to ensure clean module boundaries

## Task Distribution

- **test-coverage agent**: 14 tasks (48% of project) - All testing tasks
- **modular-builder agent**: 11 tasks (38% of project) - All implementation tasks
- **zen-architect agent**: 2 tasks - Architecture design and documentation
- **integration-specialist agent**: 1 task - CLI implementation
- **refactor-architect agent**: 1 task - Final polish

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Architecture & Test Framework
- Design modular architecture with clear boundaries
- Create file-based test framework with diff comparison

### Phase 2-12: Feature Implementation (Test-Driven)
Each phase follows strict test-first pattern:
1. Create comprehensive file-based tests (minimum test cases specified)
2. Implement feature to pass all tests

Features covered:
- Buffer management (line storage, cursor tracking)
- Navigation commands (h,j,k,l,w,b,$,0,gg,G)
- Insert mode (i,I,a,A,o,O with text entry)
- Delete operations (x,dd,dw,d$)
- Copy/paste (yy,yw,p,P)
- Visual mode (v,V selection)
- Undo/redo (u, Ctrl-r)
- Search (/,?,n,N)
- Replace (:s commands)
- File I/O (:w,:q,:wq,:q!)
- Display/UI (line numbers, status bar)

### Phase 13: Integration
- Comprehensive integration tests (15+ scenarios)
- CLI implementation
- Final test verification

### Phase 14: Documentation & Polish
- User and developer documentation
- Code quality improvements and optimization

## Test Requirements

Each test phase specifies minimum test cases:
- Buffer management: 10+ test cases
- Navigation: 15+ test cases
- Insert mode: 12+ test cases
- Delete operations: 10+ test cases
- Copy/paste: 8+ test cases
- Visual mode: 8+ test cases
- Undo/redo: 6+ test cases
- Search: 8+ test cases
- Replace: 6+ test cases
- File I/O: 8+ test cases
- Display/UI: 5+ test cases
- Integration: 15+ test scenarios

**Total minimum test cases: 115+**

## Execution Strategy

The project is designed for sequential execution with clear dependencies:
- Each implementation strictly depends on its tests being complete
- Features build on each other (buffer → navigation → modes → operations)
- Integration tests verify the complete system
- Documentation captures the final implementation

## How to Execute the Project

### Using Super-Planner CLI

```bash
# Check project status
python -m amplifier.planner status 9d16c244-42ba-4ce9-91bc-cb928c869e75

# Execute ready tasks (currently: architecture design)
python -m amplifier.planner execute 9d16c244-42ba-4ce9-91bc-cb928c869e75

# Resume after interruption
python -m amplifier.planner resume 9d16c244-42ba-4ce9-91bc-cb928c869e75
```

### Using the Scripts

```bash
# Create the project (already done)
python create_vi_project.py

# Visualize project structure
python visualize_vi_project.py
```

## Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful when:
1. ✓ All 29 tasks complete successfully
2. ✓ 100% test pass rate with file-based diff comparison
3. ✓ Editor can successfully edit real files
4. ✓ All edge cases handled (empty files, large files, special characters)
5. ✓ Comprehensive documentation provided

## Current Status

- **Progress**: 0/29 tasks completed (0.0%)
- **Ready to Execute**: 1 task
  - Design modular architecture for vi editor (zen-architect)

The project is ready to begin execution. The first task will establish the architectural foundation that all subsequent tasks will build upon.

## Next Steps

1. Execute the architecture design task to establish module boundaries
2. The test framework task will then become ready
3. Continue executing tasks as they become ready, following the test-first approach
4. Monitor progress and handle any task failures
5. Verify all tests pass before marking project complete
