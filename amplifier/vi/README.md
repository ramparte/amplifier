## Architecture

The project follows a modular, "bricks and studs" design philosophy where each component is self-contained with clear interfaces:

### Core Components

#### TextBuffer (`buffer/core.py`)

The foundation of the editor - manages document content, cursor position, and state:

- **Line Management**: Stores content as list of strings, handles line operations
- **Cursor Control**: Position tracking with bounds checking, multi-directional movement
- **Marks & Jumps**: Named marks (a-z) and jump list (Ctrl-O/Ctrl-I) for navigation
- **Undo/Redo**: Full state snapshots with compound change support
- **Search State**: Pattern matching with forward/backward navigation
- **Movement Operations**: Character, word, line, and screen-relative positioning

Key Methods:
```python
buffer = TextBuffer(content="Hello World")
buffer.move_cursor(row, col)           # Absolute positioning
buffer.move_cursor_relative('j', 5)    # Relative movements (h,j,k,l)
buffer.move_word_forward(count=3)      # Word-level navigation
buffer.find_char_forward('x')          # Character search
buffer.set_named_mark('a')             # Set mark
buffer.jump_to_mark('a')               # Jump to mark
buffer.undo() / buffer.redo()          # Undo/redo operations
```

#### ModeManager (`modes/state.py`)

Comprehensive mode state management with validation and callbacks:

- **Mode Tracking**: Current mode, mode history, operator-pending states
- **Insert Variations**: Tracks which variation triggered insert (i, I, a, A, o, O, s, S, c, C)
- **Visual State**: Selection tracking, visual mode type (character/line/block)
- **Transitions**: Validated mode changes with callbacks
- **History**: Mode history for debugging and advanced features

Modes Supported:
- `NORMAL` - Default command mode
- `INSERT` - Text insertion (10 variations)

#### CommandRegistry (`commands/registry.py`)

Central command registration and dispatch system:

- **Command Definition**: Type-safe command definitions with metadata
- **Mode Awareness**: Commands registered per-mode with validation
- **Operator-Motion**: Handles operator-motion combinations (d3w, c2j)
- **Numeric Prefixes**: Count handling for repeatable commands
- **Text Objects**: Integration with text object system
- **Command History**: Last command tracking for repeat (.)

Command Types:
- `MOTION` - Cursor movement commands

## Usage Examples

### Basic Text Editing

```python
from amplifier.vi.buffer import TextBuffer
from amplifier.vi.modes.state import ModeManager
from amplifier.vi.modes.insert import InsertMode

# Initialize components
buffer = TextBuffer("Hello World\nSecond Line\nThird Line")
mode_manager = ModeManager()
insert_mode = InsertMode(buffer)

# Navigate
buffer.move_cursor_down()  # Move to line 2
buffer.move_word_forward()  # Move to next word

# Enter insert mode and edit
mode_manager.to_insert()
mode_manager.set_insert_variation("line_end")  # 'A' command
buffer.insert_text(" - edited")
mode_manager.to_normal()

# Visual selection and delete
mode_manager.to_visual()
buffer.move_cursor_down()
# Delete selection would happen here

# Undo/Redo
buffer.undo()
buffer.redo()
```

### Operator-Motion Commands

```python
from amplifier.vi.commands.registry import CommandRegistry, CommandContext
from amplifier.vi.commands.executor import CommandExecutor

# Setup
registry = CommandRegistry()
context = CommandContext(buffer=buffer, modes=mode_manager, renderer=renderer)

# Register commands
# ... command registration ...

# Execute "d3w" - delete 3 words
dispatcher.process_key('d', mode, context)  # Operator
dispatcher.process_key('3', mode, context)  # Count
dispatcher.process_key('w', mode, context)  # Motion
```

### Visual Mode Operations

```python
from amplifier.vi.modes.visual import VisualMode
from amplifier.vi.modes.buffer_adapter import BufferAdapter

# Setup
buffer_adapter = BufferAdapter(buffer)
visual_mode = VisualMode(buffer_adapter)

# Enter visual mode and select
mode_manager.to_visual()
visual_mode.enter_visual("character")
buffer.move_cursor_right(5)
visual_mode.update_selection(buffer.get_cursor())

# Get selected text
text = visual_mode.get_selected_text()

# Delete selection
visual_mode.delete_selection()
mode_manager.to_normal()
```

## Design Philosophy

This project follows the Amplifier project's core design principles:

### 1. Ruthless Simplicity
- Each module does one thing well
- Minimal abstractions - every layer must justify its existence
- Direct implementations over clever patterns

### 2. Modular "Bricks and Studs" Architecture
- Self-contained modules with clear interfaces
- Components can be regenerated from their specifications
- Public contracts (studs) remain stable while internals (bricks) can evolve

### 3. Test-Driven Behavior Validation
- Behavior tested at module boundaries
- Integration tests for component interaction
- 100% pass rate maintained

### 4. Clear Separation of Concerns
- Buffer: Data and cursor state
- Modes: Editor state and transitions
- Commands: User input to actions
- Renderer: Display and terminal integration

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for expansion (not currently prioritized):

### Advanced Features
- Ex command mode (`:` commands)
  - `:w` write, `:q` quit, `:wq` write and quit
  - `:s/pattern/replacement/` substitution
  - `:g/pattern/command` global commands
- Macro recording (`q{register}` to record, `@{register}` to play)
- Multiple buffers and windows
- Syntax highlighting
- Folding support

### Performance Optimizations
- Large file handling (lazy loading, virtual scrolling)
- Efficient search for large buffers
- Incremental rendering

### UI/UX Improvements
- Status line with mode indicator
- Command-line completion
- Visual feedback for pending operators
- Line numbers and relative line numbers

### Integration Features
- Language server protocol (LSP) support
- Git integration
- Plugin system
- Configuration file support

## Contributing

When adding new features:

1. **Define the contract first** - Update documentation with the expected behavior
2. **Write tests** - Add tests before implementation
3. **Keep it simple** - Follow the ruthless simplicity principle
4. **Maintain modularity** - New features should fit the existing architecture
5. **Document behavior** - Update this README with new capabilities

## Implementation Notes

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Immutable Text Representation**: Lines stored as list of strings for simplicity
   - Trade-off: Not optimal for very large files, but simple and correct
   - Optimization can come later if needed

2. **Snapshot-based Undo**: Full state snapshots for undo/redo
   - Trade-off: More memory usage vs. simpler implementation
   - Compound changes supported to group operations

3. **Adapter Pattern for Modes**: BufferAdapter provides clean interface
   - Decouples mode implementations from buffer internals
   - Allows buffer changes without breaking modes

4. **Registry Pattern for Commands**: Central command registration
   - Makes command system extensible
   - Supports operator-motion combinations naturally

5. **Mode Transition Validation**: Enforced valid transitions
   - Prevents invalid state combinations
   - Makes mode system more predictable
