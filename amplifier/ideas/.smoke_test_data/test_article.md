# Test Article for Smoke Testing

This is a sample article used for smoke testing the Amplifier system.

## Key Concepts

- **Testing**: Verifying that software works as expected
- **Smoke Testing**: Basic tests to ensure critical functionality works
- **AI Evaluation**: Using AI to evaluate test results

## Implementation Details

The smoke test system uses AI-driven evaluation to determine if commands succeed. When the Claude Code SDK is unavailable, tests gracefully skip AI evaluation and pass based on exit codes.

## Benefits

1. Robust testing that adapts to environment
2. Simple test definitions in YAML
3. AI-powered evaluation when available
4. Graceful degradation when AI unavailable
