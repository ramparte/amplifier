# Website Generator Tool Development Plan

## Project Overview

This folder contains the comprehensive plan for building an automated website generator tool based on the successful instructor website transformation work.

## Context

We successfully transformed the Amplifier instructor website from a basic feature showcase into a paradigm transformation experience that:
- Explains the fundamental development revolution Amplifier represents
- Uses progressive disclosure to prevent cognitive overload
- Builds trust through role elevation and safety demonstrations
- Provides concrete examples of capability multiplication
- Creates natural progression from skeptic to power user

**Goal**: Build a tool that can automatically generate similar high-quality, paradigm-aware websites for any repository, with nightly automation and perfect consistency across regenerations.

## Plan Documents

### `website-generator-tool-plan.md`
The comprehensive technical plan including:
- Analysis of transformation patterns from instructor website work
- Complete tool architecture design with folder structure
- Configuration system for preserving style/structure consistency
- Implementation strategy with 4-phase development approach
- Usage patterns and expected benefits

## Key Innovation

**Paradigm-Aware Generation**: The tool will automatically detect whether a repository represents:
- **Revolutionary Change** (like Amplifier) ‚Üí Generate full paradigm transformation content

**Paradigm Detection**: Enhanced algorithm correctly identifies revolutionary projects through:
- AI amplification keywords (claude, agent, amplifier, etc.)
- Agent count thresholds (20+ agents = revolutionary)
- Knowledge synthesis patterns
- Modular architecture indicators
- Revolutionary language detection

- `setup.html` (14KB) - Progressive setup guide
- `agents.html` (423KB) - Rich agent showcase with detailed descriptions
- `amplifier-styles.css` (18KB) - Complete responsive stylesheet
- `script.js` (3KB) - Interactive JavaScript functionality
- Complete template system for regeneration consistency

## Phase 3 Enhancement (2025-01-24) - INSTRUCTOR-LEVEL RICH CONTENT! ‚ú®

**Content Richness Enhancement**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **MAJOR IMPROVEMENT**: Enhanced agents.html from 1.8KB to 423KB (235x content increase!)
- Added detailed agent descriptions for all 23 agents with capabilities, use cases, and examples
- Created instructor-level rich content matching original site quality
- Each agent now includes:
  - Detailed descriptions explaining purpose and functionality
  - Key capabilities lists (6 items per agent)
  - Common use cases with practical examples
  - Usage examples with command syntax
  - Expected output examples
  - Advanced collapsible sections with integration patterns
- **Fixed CSS filename linking** - All pages now correctly reference "amplifier-styles.css"

## Next Steps - Future Enhancements

1. **Automation Pipeline**: Add change detection and scheduled regeneration
2. **Advanced Templates**: More section types and customization options
3. **Asset Management**: Image optimization and additional JavaScript features
4. **Phase 4**: Testing, polish, and documentation

## Usage Vision

```bash
# Generate website for any repository
website_generator generate --repo /path/to/project --output ./website

# Set up nightly automation
website_generator watch --repo /path/to/project --schedule nightly

# Regenerate with consistency validation
website_generator regenerate --repo /path/to/project --validate-consistency
```

This tool will enable any repository to get the same high-quality, paradigm-transformation website treatment that we manually created for the instructor site, with automatic updates and perfect consistency.
