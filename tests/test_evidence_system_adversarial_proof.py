"""
Adversarial End-to-End Integration Test for Evidence System.

This test proves the evidence system actually works by:
1. Attempting to cheat in multiple ways
2. Verifying each cheat is caught
3. Demonstrating that only legitimate evidence allows task completion

The test is designed to convince skeptics that the system isn't just
security theater - it actually prevents shortcuts.
