"""
Integration tests for /bplan workflow system.

Following test-first philosophy:
- Tests written BEFORE any integration code
- Tests use real components (minimal mocking)
- Tests verify end-to-end behavior
- Antagonistic tests catch shortcuts and workflow issues

Tests cover:
1. Complete workflow execution (intake -> planning -> execution -> validation -> reconciliation)
2. Agent coordination and spawning
3. State persistence across "sessions" (simulated by clearing and reloading state)
4. Beads integration throughout workflow
5. Test-first enforcement in workflow
6. Error recovery and retry mechanisms
