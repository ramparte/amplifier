# Navigation Implementation - Completed

## Summary

Successfully implemented and tested navigation commands for the vi editor Python rewrite project.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Navigation Command Tests (test-coverage)
- Created 20 comprehensive test cases covering all navigation commands
- Tests located in `/workspaces/amplifier/vi_editor_project/tests/navigation/`
- Test categories:
  - Basic movements: h, j, k, l (left, down, up, right)
  - Word movements: w, b (forward, backward)
  - Line movements: 0, $ (start, end)
  - File movements: gg, G (file start, end)
  - Numbered movements: 5j, 10l, 3k, 5h
  - Boundary testing: file boundaries, line boundaries, empty lines
  - Complex navigation sequences

### 2. Navigation Implementation (modular-builder)
- Implemented `command_mode.py` module with CommandMode class
- Features:
  - All basic vi navigation commands (h,j,k,l,w,b,0,$,gg,G)
  - Numeric prefixes for repeated movements (5j, 10l, etc.)
  - Proper boundary checking (can't move past file/line limits)
  - Word movement with punctuation handling
  - Integration with Buffer class for cursor management

## Test Results

```
Navigation Test Results: 20 passed, 0 failed
Success rate: 20/20 (100%)
```

All navigation tests are passing successfully!

## Project Status

- **Overall Progress**: 6/29 tasks completed (20%)
- **Next Ready Task**: Create insert mode tests (test-coverage agent)

## Files Created/Modified

1. `/workspaces/amplifier/vi_editor_project/command_mode.py` - Navigation command implementation
2. `/workspaces/amplifier/vi_editor_project/create_navigation_tests.py` - Test generation script
3. `/workspaces/amplifier/vi_editor_project/test_navigation.py` - Test runner for navigation
4. `/workspaces/amplifier/vi_editor_project/tests/navigation/` - 20 test case directories

## Technical Implementation Details

The navigation implementation follows the modular architecture defined in the project:
- Uses the Buffer class for cursor position management
- Implements the CommandMode class for handling command mode operations
- Supports all standard vi navigation commands with proper edge case handling
- Maintains clean separation of concerns between navigation and buffer management
