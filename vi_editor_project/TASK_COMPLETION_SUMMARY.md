## Files Created This Session

1. `/workspaces/amplifier/vi_editor_project/test_visual.py` - Visual mode tests
2. `/workspaces/amplifier/vi_editor_project/visual_mode.py` - Visual mode implementation
3. `/workspaces/amplifier/vi_editor_project/test_undo_redo.py` - Undo/redo tests
4. `/workspaces/amplifier/vi_editor_project/undo_redo.py` - Undo/redo implementation
5. `/workspaces/amplifier/vi_editor_project/test_search.py` - Search tests
6. `/workspaces/amplifier/vi_editor_project/search.py` - Search implementation

## Remaining Tasks

### High Priority (Core Functionality)
1. **Replace Commands** - Create tests and implement replace operations (r, R)
2. **File I/O** - Create tests and implement file operations (:w, :q, :e)
3. **Display/UI** - Create tests and implement terminal UI

### Medium Priority (Integration)
4. **Integration Tests** - Comprehensive end-to-end testing
5. **CLI Interface** - Command-line interface implementation
6. **Integration Verification** - Ensure all components work together

### Low Priority (Polish)
7. **Documentation** - User and developer documentation
8. **Optimization** - Performance tuning and polish

## Technical Notes

### Code Quality
- All implementations follow TDD approach with tests written first
- Consistent architecture across all modules
- Proper separation of concerns
- Type hints used throughout
- Comprehensive docstrings

### Integration Points
The new modules need to be integrated with the main editor:
- Visual mode needs to hook into command mode handlers
- Undo/redo needs to wrap all state-changing operations
- Search needs to be accessible from command mode

### Known Issues
- Some linting errors exist in older files (command_mode.py, test_framework.py)
- These don't affect the new functionality but should be addressed

## Next Steps

To continue the project:
1. Run the existing tests to verify implementations
2. Integrate new modules with the main editor
3. Continue with remaining tasks (replace, file I/O, display)
4. Perform integration testing
5. Add documentation and polish

## Command to Resume

To continue work on this project, use:
```bash
python -c "from amplifier.planner import load_project; p = load_project('9d16c244-42ba-4ce9-91bc-cb928c869e75'); print(p)"
```

Then execute remaining tasks using the orchestrator or manual implementation.
