- **Expected:** Specific lines deleted (100, 500, 997-998)
- **Actual:** Wrong lines deleted, extra lines present
- **Impact:** Editor behavior unreliable with large files

## Root Cause Analysis

Based on failure patterns, the issues likely stem from:

1. **Cursor positioning bugs** - Insert mode, line boundaries, goto commands all show positioning issues
2. **Buffer state management** - Yank/paste operations and undo showing state corruption
3. **Command parsing** - Change commands and visual mode selections not being recognized/executed
4. **Mode transitions** - Insert mode and visual mode state not being properly managed
5. **Count prefixes** - Numbered commands (3x, 5x, etc.) not being parsed or applied correctly

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Block Production)

1. **DO NOT deploy** - Editor is not functional for basic operations
2. **Debug insert mode** - Fix cursor positioning and text insertion (test_01, test_04, test_17)
3. **Fix yank/paste** - Resolve buffer state issues (test_02, test_11)
4. **Repair visual mode** - Visual selection and operations completely broken (test_03, test_18)

### High Priority Fixes

5. **Line operations** - Fix `dd`, `cc`, `gg`, `G` commands
6. **Delete operations** - Repair `dw`, `x` with count prefixes
7. **Search/replace** - Fix `/` search and `:s` substitute commands
8. **Undo/redo** - Ensure history management works correctly

### Testing Strategy

1. **Fix one category at a time** - Start with insert mode (highest impact)
2. **Verify unit tests** - Ensure individual components work before integration
3. **Re-run integration tests** - After each fix, measure improvement
4. **Add regression tests** - Create specific tests for each bug fixed

## Test Details

### Passing Tests Details

#### test_08_word_navigation_edit ✅
- Actions: Word forward/back (w, b), delete word (dw)
- Validates: Basic word-level navigation and editing
- Conclusion: Core word operations functional

#### test_12_insert_mode_variations ✅
- Actions: i, a, o, A, I, O insert commands
- Validates: Multiple ways to enter insert mode
- Conclusion: Insert mode entry points work

#### test_13_empty_lines_navigation ✅
- Actions: Navigate through lines with empty lines present
- Validates: Movement doesn't break on empty lines
- Conclusion: Empty line handling correct

### Sample Failure Details

#### test_01_insert_navigate_delete ❌
```
Input:  "Line one" / "Line two" / "Line three"
Actions: i, Hello, <ESC>, j, A, World, <ESC>, k, dw
Expected: "one" / "Line two World" / "Line three"
Actual: "Hello Line on" / "Line two World" / "Line three"
```
**Analysis:** Insert at position 0 (`i`) should position cursor before first char, allowing "Hello" to be inserted, then deleted with `dw`. Instead, text is being inserted incorrectly.

#### test_02_yank_paste_undo ❌
```
Input: 4 lines starting with "First line"
Actions: yy, p, p, u
Expected: First line appears 3 times at top (yank, paste, paste, undo last paste)
Actual: First line appears 4 times (extra paste not undone)
```
**Analysis:** Either paste is executing twice per `p`, or undo is not working.

#### test_05_replace_and_search ❌
```
Input: "The banana is yellow"
Actions: /banana<ENTER>, 5rx, n
Expected: "The xxxxx is yellow" (replace 5 chars with 'x')
Actual: "-nana5rxhe apple is red"
```
**Analysis:** Complete failure of search and/or replace command. Output is corrupted.

## Conclusion

The vi editor is in **early development state** with fundamental operations broken. The codebase requires:

- **Major debugging effort** across all core modules
- **Unit test validation** to ensure components work individually
- **Integration test fixes** to verify end-to-end workflows
- **Regression test suite** to prevent re-introduction of bugs

**Estimated effort:** 40-80 hours of focused debugging and testing to reach production quality.

**Recommendation:** Return to unit testing phase, fix core components, then re-run integration suite.
