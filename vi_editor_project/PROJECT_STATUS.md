# Vi Editor Project - Execution Status Report

## Project Overview
**Project**: Vi Editor Python Rewrite with TDD
**Project ID**: 9d16c244-42ba-4ce9-91bc-cb928c869e75
**Execution Date**: 2025-10-12

## Progress Summary
- **Overall Progress**: 4/29 tasks completed (13%)
- **Tasks Completed**: 4
- **Tasks Pending**: 25
- **Execution Time**: ~9 minutes

## Completed Tasks

### 1. âœ… Design Modular Architecture (zen-architect)
- Created comprehensive `ARCHITECTURE.md` document
- Defined 9 core modules with clear interfaces
- Established module dependencies and data flow
- Specified testing strategy alignment

### 2. âœ… Create File-Based Test Framework (test-coverage)
- Implemented `test_framework.py` with complete testing infrastructure
- Created `TestRunner`, `FileBasedTest`, and `ActionParser` classes
- Supports special key sequences and action parsing
- Includes diff-based comparison and test discovery

### 3. âœ… Create Buffer Management Tests (test-coverage)
- Generated 12 comprehensive test cases in `tests/buffer/`
- Tests cover:
  - Empty file handling
  - Single/multi-line navigation
  - Line insertion/deletion
  - Character operations
  - Large files (1000+ lines)
  - Unicode and special characters
  - Cursor boundaries
  - Empty line handling

### 4. âœ… Implement Buffer Management Module (modular-builder)
- Created `buffer.py` with complete buffer implementation
- Features:
  - Line-based text storage
  - Cursor position tracking
  - Line/character operations
  - Boundary constraint handling
  - Snapshot/restore for undo
  - Support for large files

## Next Ready Task
- **Create navigation command tests** (test-coverage)
  - Implement h,j,k,l movement tests
  - Word movement (w,b) tests
  - Line/file navigation (0,$,gg,G)
  - Numbered movements
  - 15 test cases minimum

## Execution Notes

### Super-Planner Integration
- Successfully executed tasks from super-planner project
- Tasks were completed following TDD approach
- Each task built upon previous dependencies

### Architecture Highlights
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- File-based testing for transparency and debugging
- Support for comprehensive vi functionality
- Extensible framework for future features

### Technical Decisions
- Line-based buffer storage for simplicity
- 0-based indexing for cursor position
- Snapshot-based undo/redo system
- Action parsing with special key support

## Recommendations for Next Session

1. **Continue Task Execution**: Resume with navigation tests and implementation
2. **Parallel Development**: Multiple test suites can be created in parallel
3. **Integration Testing**: Start integration tests once core modules complete
4. **Performance Testing**: Validate large file handling with actual tests

## Project Health
- âœ… Clear architecture established
- âœ… Testing framework operational
- âœ… Core buffer module implemented
- âœ… TDD workflow validated
- ðŸ”„ 25 tasks remaining for full implementation

## Command to Resume
To continue this project in the next session:
```bash
/superplanner execute 9d16c244-42ba-4ce9-91bc-cb928c869e75
