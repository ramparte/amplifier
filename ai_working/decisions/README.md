# Decision Tracking System

## Purpose

This directory serves as the **institutional memory** for architectural and implementation decisions made throughout the project's evolution. It addresses a critical challenge in AI-assisted development: context loss between conversations and the tendency to revisit or reverse decisions without understanding their original rationale.

## Philosophy

### Why Decision Tracking Matters

1. **Context Preservation**: AI assistants lose context between sessions. This system preserves the "why" behind decisions.
2. **Informed Evolution**: Decisions CAN and SHOULD change, but only with full understanding of original reasoning.
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Over time, patterns emerge showing which types of decisions tend to be stable vs. volatile.
4. **Learning from History**: Prevents repeating mistakes or rediscovering already-explored dead ends.

### Core Principles

- **Decisions are not permanent** - They can be changed, but should be changed thoughtfully
- **Context is everything** - The reasoning matters more than the decision itself
- **Brief but complete** - Capture enough to understand, not so much it won't be read
- **Living documents** - Update when decisions evolve, don't just create new ones

## Structure

Each decision document follows this format:

```markdown
# [DECISION-XXX] Title

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Status**: Active | Superseded | Deprecated
**Superseded by**: [DECISION-YYY] (if applicable)

## Context

What situation or problem prompted this decision?

## Decision

What was decided?

## Rationale

Why was this chosen over alternatives?

## Alternatives Considered

- Option A: [description] - Rejected because...
- Option B: [description] - Rejected because...

## Consequences

- Positive: What benefits this brings
- Negative: What trade-offs were accepted
- Risks: What could go wrong

## Review Triggers

When should this decision be reconsidered?

- [ ] Specific event or milestone
- [ ] Time-based (e.g., "after 3 months")
- [ ] Metric-based (e.g., "if performance degrades")

## References

Articles, documentation, or other sources that influenced this decision:

- [Article Title](original URL) - Key insight
- [External Resource](URL) - What it contributed
```

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Create a Decision Record

Create a new decision record when:

- Making architectural choices that affect system structure
- Choosing between multiple viable approaches
- Adopting new tools, libraries, or patterns
- Establishing conventions or standards
- Reversing or modifying previous decisions

### When to Reference Decision Records

Reference existing decisions when:

- Questioned about why something is done a certain way
- Considering changes to established patterns
- Onboarding new team members or AI assistants
- Evaluating whether circumstances have changed

### When to Update Decision Records

Update records when:

- The decision is modified but not completely reversed
- New information validates or challenges the decision
- Consequences (positive or negative) become apparent
- Review triggers are reached

## Integration with AI Workflow

### For AI Assistants

1. **Before proposing changes**: Check for relevant decision records
2. **When making significant choices**: Document the decision
3. **If confused about existing patterns**: Look for historical context
4. **When user questions approach**: Reference the decision record

### For Humans

1. **Provide decision records** in initial context when relevant
2. **Ask AI to check decisions** before major changes
3. **Request decision documentation** for significant choices
4. **Review and validate** AI-created decision records

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Decision Paralysis**: Don't document every tiny choice
❌ **Write-Only Memory**: Don't create records that are never referenced
❌ **Perfectionism**: Better to have an imperfect record than none
❌ **Rigid Adherence**: Decisions are guides, not laws

## Remember

This system exists to make us smarter over time, not to create bureaucracy. If it's not helping, it should be changed. The goal is to build a learning system that gets better with each iteration, not a rigid framework that constrains innovation.
