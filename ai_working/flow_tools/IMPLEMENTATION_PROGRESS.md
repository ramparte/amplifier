### Progress Notes

**2025-01-20 14:30**: Starting Phase 0 - searching for DotRunner code and documentation...

**2025-01-20 14:35**: ✅ **Found DotRunner** at `/workspaces/amplifier/ai_working/dotrunner/`

**API Verification Results:**

✅ **`Workflow.from_yaml(path)` - EXISTS AND WORKS**
- Location: `ai_working/dotrunner/workflow.py` line 204
- Loads YAML, validates, returns Workflow instance
- Raises ValueError on validation errors

✅ **`Workflow.validate()` - EXISTS AND WORKS**
- Location: `ai_working/dotrunner/workflow.py` line 103
- Returns list of validation errors (empty if valid)
- Checks: node existence, unique IDs, valid references, no cycles

✅ **`extract_variables(template)` - EXISTS AND WORKS**
- Location: `ai_working/dotrunner/context.py` line 35
- Extracts {variable} patterns from strings
- Returns set of variable names
- Used for finding required inputs

✅ **`agent_mode` field - EXISTS AND DOCUMENTED**
- Location: `ai_working/dotrunner/workflow.py` line 63
- Valid values: "ANALYZE", "EVALUATE", "EXECUTE", "REVIEW", "GENERATE"
- Also accepts natural language strings
- Optional field (can be None)

✅ **`dotrunner run` command - EXISTS AND WORKS**
- CLI: `python -m ai_working.dotrunner run <file> --context '<json>'`
- Options: `--context` (JSON string), `--no-save` (skip checkpoints)
- Output format: Rich console with status, timing, node results
- Creates session IDs automatically
- Exit code: 0 for success, 1 for failure

✅ **Output Format Documented:**
```
Loading workflow: <name>
Starting workflow: <name>

[Node execution output streams here]

✓/✗ Workflow completed/failed: [error if failed]

Summary:
  • Total time: X.XXs
  • Nodes completed: X/Y
  • Session ID: <id> (if saved)

Node Results:
  ✓/✗ <node_id> (X.XXs)
```

### API Summary for Flow Builder

**Available for Phase 1:**
1. ✅ `Workflow.from_yaml(Path)` → Load and validate workflow
2. ✅ `workflow.validate()` → Get validation errors
3. ✅ `extract_variables(str)` → Find {variables} in templates
4. ✅ `workflow.to_dict()` → Convert to YAML-ready dict (line 294)

**Available for Phase 5 (Executor):**
1. ✅ CLI: `python -m ai_working.dotrunner run <file> --context '<json>'`
2. ✅ Context extraction: `extract_variables(prompt)`
3. ✅ Output streaming: Parse Rich console output
4. ✅ Session management: Automatic, saved to `.beads/evidence/dotrunner/`

### Test Execution Results

Tested with `ai_working/dotrunner/examples/simple_linear.yaml`:
- ✅ Workflow loads successfully
- ✅ Validation works (caught missing `file_path` context variable)
- ✅ Error reporting clear and actionable
- ✅ Exit codes correct (1 for failure)

### Conclusions

**All assumptions verified!** No spec changes needed.

**Phase 0 COMPLETE** ✅

Ready to proceed to Phase 1.
