# Amplifier Component Catalog

Amplifier's modular architecture allows you to mix and match capabilities. This page catalogs all available components in the Amplifier ecosystem—core infrastructure, applications, libraries, bundles, and runtime modules.

---

## Documentation & Learning

These are the canonical documentation and learning sites for the Amplifier ecosystem. They reflect the framework but do not run it.

| Component | Description | Repository |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **amplifier-app-learn** | Interactive learning curriculum for Amplifier — six narrative levels, hands-on approach guides, validated architecture diagrams, and a chat assistant with live DOT rendering. React 19 + Vite SPA. | [amplifier-app-learn](https://github.com/michaeljabbour/amplifier-app-learn) |
| **amplifier-docs** | Documentation for the Amplifier project | [amplifier-docs](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-docs) |

---

## Libraries

Foundational libraries used by **applications** (not used directly by runtime modules).

| Component | Description | Repository |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **amplifier-foundation** | Foundational library for bundles, module resolution, and shared utilities | [amplifier-foundation](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-foundation) |

**Usage**: Bundles are loaded via the `amplifier bundle` commands:

```bash
# Add a bundle to the registry (name auto-derived from bundle metadata)
amplifier bundle add git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-bundle-recipes@main

# Use a bundle by name
amplifier bundle use foundation
amplifier bundle use recipes

# Show current bundle
amplifier bundle current

# Check for bundle updates
amplifier bundle update --check

# Update bundle to latest
amplifier bundle update
```

**Creating Bundles**: See the [Bundle Guide](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-foundation/blob/main/docs/BUNDLE_GUIDE.md) for how to create your own bundles.

## Building Your Own Modules

Amplifier can help you build Amplifier modules! See [DEVELOPER.md](./DEVELOPER.md) for how to use AI to create custom modules with minimal manual coding.

The modular architecture makes it easy to:
- Extend capabilities with new tools
- Add support for new AI providers
- Create domain-specific agents
- Build custom interfaces (web, mobile, voice)
- Experiment with new orchestration strategies

---

## Module Architecture

All modules follow the same pattern:

1. **Entry point**: Implement `mount(coordinator, config)` function
2. **Registration**: Register capabilities with the coordinator
3. **Isolation**: Handle errors gracefully, never crash the kernel
4. **Contracts**: Follow one of the stable interfaces (Tool, Provider, Hook, etc.)

For technical details, see:
- [amplifier-core](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-core) - Kernel interfaces and protocols
