# PoC-First Development Pattern

## Pattern Description

Build a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** with mock/hard-coded implementation first to:
1. Validate the architecture and interfaces
2. Demonstrate value to stakeholders
3. Test the user experience
4. THEN implement the real functionality

## Example: Knowledge Mining System

### What We Did

1. **Built Mock First** (Day 1)
   - Hard-coded pattern extraction
   - Fixed "143% improvement" demo
   - Simple keyword matching
   - Pre-determined results

2. **Validated Approach** (Day 2)
   - User tested the commands
   - Confirmed the architecture made sense
   - Identified that it was just a mock
   - Agreed the approach was valuable

3. **Implemented Real System** (Day 3)
   - Replaced mock with Claude Code SDK integration
   - Kept exact same interfaces (the "studs")
   - All existing code continued to work
   - Real semantic extraction now functioning

### Benefits of This Approach

1. **Fast Validation**: Get feedback on the concept before investing in complex implementation
2. **Clear Interfaces**: Mock forces you to define clean contracts early
3. **Risk Reduction**: Discover architectural issues before writing complex code
4. **User Alignment**: Ensure you're building what the user actually wants
5. **Modular Development**: Can replace mock with real implementation seamlessly

### When to Use This Pattern

✅ **Good for:**
- New features with uncertain requirements
- Complex integrations (test the interface first)
- Demonstrating value to stakeholders
- Exploring architectural approaches

❌ **Not good for:**
- Simple CRUD operations
- Well-defined requirements
- Performance-critical code
- Security-sensitive implementations

### Implementation Steps

1. **Design the Interface**
   - Define data structures (dataclasses, types)
   - Create public methods
   - Document expected behavior

2. **Build Mock Implementation**
   - Hard-code reasonable responses
   - Focus on the "happy path"
   - Make it believable but simple

3. **Create Demo/Test**
   - Show concrete value
   - Use realistic scenarios
   - Include metrics if relevant

4. **Get Feedback**
   - Run the demo
   - Gather user input
   - Identify gaps

5. **Replace with Real Implementation**
   - Keep interfaces unchanged
   - Add proper error handling
   - Implement edge cases
   - Remove hard-coded values

### Key Insight

The mock IS the specification. By building it first, you:
- Force clarity on what you're building
- Create testable interfaces immediately
- Can parallelize development (UI team uses mock while backend builds real)
- Reduce wasted effort on wrong implementations

### Code Example

```python
# Step 1: Mock Implementation
class KnowledgeExtractor:
    def extract(self, text: str) -> Extraction:
        # Hard-coded for PoC
        if "microservices" in text.lower():
            return Extraction(
                concepts=[Concept("Microservices", "Architecture pattern")],
                insights=["Use service discovery"]
            )
        return Extraction()

# Step 2: Real Implementation (same interface!)
class KnowledgeExtractor:
    def extract(self, text: str) -> Extraction:
        # Real LLM extraction
        response = await claude_sdk.extract(text)
        return Extraction(
            concepts=parse_concepts(response),
            insights=parse_insights(response)
        )
```

## Conclusion

Building a PoC first is not "wasting time" - it's **validating direction**. The mock becomes the contract, the demo proves value, and the real implementation slots in seamlessly.

This approach aligns perfectly with our modular "bricks and studs" philosophy: build the interface (studs) first with a mock brick, validate it works, then replace with the real brick.
